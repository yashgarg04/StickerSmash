# StickerSmash

Created a universal app that runs on Android, iOS, and the web; all with a single codebase.

The objective of this project is to get started with Expo and become familiar with the Expo SDK. It'll cover the following topics:
1. Create an Expo App
2. Break down the app layout and implement it with flexbox
3. Use each platform's system UI to select an image from the media library
4. Create a sticker modal using the <Modal> and <FlatList> components from React Native
5. Add touch gestures to interact with a sticker
6. Use third-party libraries to capture a screenshot and save it to the disk
7. Handle platform differences between Android, iOS, and web
8. Finally, go through the process of configuring a status bar, a splash screen, and an icon to complete the app.

These topics will provide a good foundation for learning the fundamentals of building a mobile app.


In the project directory, run the following command to start a development server from the terminal:
